<h1>Integrative Biology 200 <br>
<small>Principles of Phylogenetics: Ecology and Evolution</small></h1>

<p><i>Spring 2014 meeting times:<br> Monday and Wednesday, 2:00 - 4:00 pm, room 3083 VLSB<br>Friday, 3:00 - 5:00pm, room 3083 VLSB</i></p>
<p>"Principles of Phylogenetics: Ecology and Evolution" (IB200) covers the core theory and methods for comparative biology: phylogenetic analysis with emphases on both morphology and molecules, and both living and fossil organisms.  We use this historical framework to answer ecological and evolutionary questions.  This course covers applications of phylogenetics to ecology, evolution, development, functional morphology, populational genetics, conservation, biogeogeography, and speciation.  Labs are closely integrated with lectures and will cover the major algorithms and computer software to implement these approaches.</p>

<p>Requirements include participation in discussion, two quizzes, and a term project.  This project will be a phylogenetic analysis of the interrelationships among a set of taxa using all major available methodologies. In addition to a written report in the form of a journal publication, project results will be presented in a mini-symposium at the end of the term. We encourage you to focus on organisms that you are studying for your thesis or other research, making this course an excellent way to accomplish preliminary research suitable for later funding requests and publications.</p>

<p>IB 200 is taught every other Spring semester and is intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduates.</p>
